API basics: 
You should have a good understanding of what an API is, how it works, and how it can be exploited by attackers.

HTTP Protocol: 
You should have a good understanding of the HTTP protocol, which is commonly used for API communication.

RESTful APIs: 
Most APIs are RESTful APIs, which have a set of standardized methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for interacting with the API. You should have a good understanding of these methods and how they can be used to interact with the API.

API authentication and authorization: 
APIs often require authentication and authorization to access their resources. You should have a good understanding of different authentication and authorization methods and how to bypass them.

API vulnerabilities: 
You should have a good understanding of common API vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, broken authentication and session management, and insecure direct object references.

API penetration testing tools: 
You should be familiar with API penetration testing tools such as OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Postman. These tools can be used to analyze API traffic, test for vulnerabilities, and intercept and modify API requests.

Online resources: 
There are several online resources such as tutorials, videos, and forums that can help you learn API penetration testing. You can also participate in online communities to learn from experts and share your knowledge with others.
